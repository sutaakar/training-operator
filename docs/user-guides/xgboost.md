# XGBoost Guide

This guide describes how to run distributed [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/) training on
Kubernetes with TrainJob.

## Prerequisites

Before exploring this guide, make sure to follow
[the Getting Started guide](../getting-started/index)
to understand the basics of Kubeflow Trainer.

## XGBoost Overview

XGBoost supports distributed training through the
[Collective](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/kubernetes.html)
communication protocol (historically known as Rabit). In a distributed setting,
multiple worker processes each operate on a shard of the data and synchronize
histogram bin statistics via AllReduce to agree on the best tree splits.

Kubeflow Trainer integrates with XGBoost by:

- Deploying worker pods as a [JobSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset).
- Automatically injecting the `DMLC_*` environment variables required by XGBoost's
 Collective communication layer (`DMLC_TRACKER_URI`, `DMLC_TRACKER_PORT`,
 `DMLC_TASK_ID`, `DMLC_NUM_WORKER`).
- Providing the rank-0 pod with the tracker address so user code can start a
 `RabitTracker` for worker coordination.
- Supporting both CPU and GPU training workloads.

The built-in runtime is called `xgboost-distributed` and uses the container image
`ghcr.io/kubeflow/trainer/xgboost-runtime:latest`, which includes XGBoost with
CUDA 12 support, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

### Worker Count

The total number of XGBoost workers is calculated as:

```text
DMLC_NUM_WORKER = numNodes × workersPerNode
```

- **CPU training**: 1 worker per node. Each worker uses OpenMP to parallelize
 across all available CPU cores.
- **GPU training**: 1 worker per GPU. The GPU count is derived from
 `resourcesPerNode` limits in the TrainJob.

## Distributed Training Function

Your training function runs on every XGBoost worker. The Kubeflow XGBoost runtime
injects the `DMLC_*` environment variables automatically.

```python
from kubeflow.trainer import TrainerClient, CustomTrainer

    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    ):
        X, y = make_classification(

            n_classes=2,
            random_state=42 + rank,
        )
        X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(
            X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
        )

        dtrain = xgb.QuantileDMatrix(X_train, label=y_train)
        dvalid = xgb.QuantileDMatrix(X_valid, label=y_valid, ref=dtrain)

        params = {
            "objective": "binary:logistic",

            "eta": 0.1,
            "eval_metric": "logloss",
        }

        model = xgb.train(
            params,
            dtrain,
            num_boost_round=50,
            evals=[(dvalid, "validation")],
            verbose_eval=10,
        )

        preds = model.predict(dvalid)
        predictions = [1 if p > 0.5 else 0 for p in preds]
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_valid, predictions)
        print(f"Worker {rank} - Validation Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

        if coll.get_rank() == 0:
            model.save_model("/workspace/xgboost_model.json")

    if tracker is not None:
        tracker.wait_for()


client = TrainerClient()
job_id = client.train(
    runtime=client.get_runtime("xgboost-distributed"),
    trainer=CustomTrainer(func=xgboost_train_classification, num_nodes=2),
)
client.wait_for_job_status(job_id)
print("\n".join(client.get_job_logs(name=job_id)))
