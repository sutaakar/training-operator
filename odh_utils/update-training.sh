# This script adjusts a running OLM-deployed ODH/RHODS operator to use custom
# component manifests, based on the 'hack/component-dev/README.md'.
#
# It is designed to deploy the 'trainingoperator' component from local manifests.
#
# THIS IS FOR DEVELOPMENT USE ONLY. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - 'oc' CLI installed and logged into an OpenShift cluster.
# - 'jq' CLI installed (for JSON parsing).
# - The ODH/RHODS operator must be installed via OLM and in a "Succeeded" state.
